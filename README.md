# CloudLogPredictor

CloudLogPredictor is an innovative log analytics project aimed at foreseeing and pinpointing incidents within a cloud-based system architecture before they transpire. Utilizing real-world log data, this project seeks to not only identify potential incidents but also determine their probable locations, thereby enabling a proactive approach to incident management.
Data source : the event log was extracted from data gathered from the audit system of an instance of the ServiceNow platform used by an IT company and enriched with data loaded from a relational database.
